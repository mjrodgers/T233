      This package determines the rank and the (G)-orbit of tensors in the 18-dimensional vector space V = F<sub>q</sub><sup>2</sup> &#x22C6; F<sub>q</sub><sup>3</sup> &#x22C6; F<sub>q</sub><sup>3</sup>,
      over the finite field F<sub>q</sub> with q elements, where G &le; GL(18, q) is the natural group preserving the set of tensors of rank one in V.
    </Para>
    <Para>
      The algorithms depend on the classification of 2 &times; 3 &times; 3 tensors. The code is written in the GAP language and uses functionality from the GAP package FinInG.
      Tensors are represented by points in the projective space PG(V).
