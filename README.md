# The GAP package T233

This package determines the rank
and the \(G\)-orbit of tensors in the 18-dimensional
vector space 
$$V=\mathbb{F}_q^2\otimes\mathbb{F}_q^3\otimes\mathbb{F}_q^3,$$
over the finite field \({\mathbb{F}}_q\) with \(q\) elements,
where \(G\leq\) GL\((18,q)\) is the natural group
preserving the set of tensors of rank one in \(V\).

<p>The algorithms depend on the classification of \(2\times 3 \times
3\) tensors from <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0024379515001494">[Lavrauw-Sheekey 2015]</a>, which is summarised in this
<a href="https://osebje.famnit.upr.si/~michel.lavrauw/T233/table1.html">table</a>. The code is written in the <a
href="http://www.gap-system.org">GAP</a>-language and uses some
functionality from the GAP package <a
href="https://www.gap-system.org/Packages/fining.html#:~:text=FinInG%20is%20a%20package%20for,flat%20lands%20of%20generalised%20polygons">FinInG</a>. Tensors are represented by
points in the projective space PG\((V)\).
